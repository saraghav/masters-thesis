\label{sec:system_design}

The dBHound app is designed to simulate a layer between the raw audio stream and voice-enabled mobile applications.
 The applications only receive the obfuscated audio stream for providing their voice-enabled features.
 Any application that requires access to raw audio needs to request for permission from the user every time.

\TODO{figure illustrating this concept}.

For preserving privacy, I propose a two-part solution:
\begin{itemize}
\item A computationally light transformation that removes conversational information from audio but preserves the ability to recognize a desired list of keywords.
\item A computationally light inference technique to spot the keywords from a stream of transformed audio data.
\end{itemize}
