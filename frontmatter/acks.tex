\begin{wbepi}{Albert Einstein}
Every one who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the Universe-a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor Professor Suman Banerjee for being an incredible mentor during my time at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
 His vision and guidance have helped shape my research skills and have been the strongest force in showing me the wonders of academic life.


Next, I would like to thank my research mentor, Neil Klingensmith, without whose guidance I wouldn't have learnt half as much as I have.
 I cannot imagine a better grad school experience without the endless brainstorming discussions, support and encouragement from Neil.


Thank you to the Computer Sciences and Electrical Engineering departments at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for providing a wonderful research atmosphere.


Finally, thank you to my family, friends and loved ones. Thank you to my friends Bharadhwaj, Prashanth, Shruthi, Abisheik, Swami and many others for putting up with my quirkiness through 2.5 years of grad school.
 Thank you to Aparna for helping me find a balance between work and life.
 Thank you to my Mom and Dad for always having my back and giving me the confidence to pursue my interests.
