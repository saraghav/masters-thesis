\section{Conclusion}

I present a simple, computationally light approach to uncover power measurements of wireless spectrum for sparse samples.
 I evaluate the performance of matrix completion on 6-months of data collected in a mid-size US city.
 I show that it is possible to achieve good performance even with simplified linearity assumptions which show the promise of this technique.


This approach can be potentially used to benefit applications such as QuickC \cite{QuickC} which aim at improving wireless backhaul.
 With large amounts of spectrum measurement data being gathered across the world \cite{SpectrumForCogRadio1} \cite{ChicagoSpectrum} \cite{ChicagoSpectrum2} \cite{SpectrumDynamics} I believe that this approach would be useful to draw better inferences from spectrum data.
 Additionally, this approach decreases the measurement burden in acquiring spatially and temporally dense spectrum measurements since I show that it is possble to uncover missing measurements from sparse spectrum samples.
